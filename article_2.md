Science of the total environment 2019

* WWTPs are not designed to remove CECs and secondary (e.g., conventional activated sludge process, CAS) and tertiary (such as filtration and disinfection) traetments are not effective in the removal of mosr CECs entering WWTP.污水处理厂的二级处理和三级处理不能有效地去除新兴污染物。The wide and frequent occurrence of CECs in the environment and the inefficiency of conventional WWTPs for their removal put the attention on these substances.广泛而频繁存在，低效去除。

* ozonation, AC adsorption and NF/RO membranes能有效去除CECs。其中Ozonation和AC过程被越来越多地被应用到污水处理厂中。

> Ozonation会产生氧化/消毒副产物（如NDMA和溴化物等），因而需要增加后续处理过程，如biological active sand filter（生物活性滤地）。

> AC 活性炭吸附不能有效地inactivation of bacteria（灭活细菌）。为满足严格的回用水质标准，需要增加消毒过程。

> 膜技术，包括nanofiltration or reverse osmosis（纳滤或反渗透），能量需求较高，并且有潜在的concentrate disposal（浓缩污染物）的风险，但同时其也能除盐进一步提高水质。

> AOPs（深度氧化技术）是近年来被较多推荐的深度处理技术。尽管其能有效地降解CECs，尤其是homogeneous photo driven（均相光氧化，如UV/H2O2和photo-Fenton）和heterogeneous photocatalytic processes（非均相光催化氧化，如UV/TiO2），但其实际应用较少。

* Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), personal care products, pesticides, synthetic and natural hormones, and industrial chemicals (such as flame retardants, plasticizers, food additives, among others) are continuously discharged into the environment through different anthropogenic sources, which can result in toxic and adverse effects on ecosystems and consequently on humans.This group of chemicals, typically detected in aquatic ecosystems and wastewater at low concentrations(ng/L-μg/L), is also referred to as contaminants of emerging concerns(CECs).新兴污染物不断从人为源排放入环境中，造成生态健康风险。新兴污染物在环境中的检测浓度通常为ng/L-μg/L.

>> The newer European Union Directive 2013/39/EU recommended monitoting and treatment solutions for a gloup of 45 PS, meeting the requirements of environmental protection. The first Watch List of substances for European Union-wide monitoring was reported in the Decision 2015/495/EU of 20 March 2015 and updated in Decision 2018/840/EU of 5 June 2018. The list refers to different CECs:

|antibiotics|synthetic hormones|natural hormones|PhACs|pesticides|UV filter|antioxidant
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|azithromycin|17‑alpha‑ethinylestradiol (EE2)|17‑beta‑estradiol (E2)|diclofenac|methiocarb|2‑ethylhexyl‑4‑methoxycinnamate|2,6‑di‑tert‑butyl‑4‑methylphenol|

* The release of CECSs from WWTPs into the environment has not yet been regulated (except in Switzerland) nor their occurence in wastewater for agricultrual reuse.新兴污染物随污水回用被释放到环境中，可被农作物吸收。但是目前WWTPs出水或灌溉回用水中CECs的浓度并没有相应的控制标准。

* 目前有些国家对再生水中有控制标准，但在欧洲还在讨论中，尤其是对用于农业灌溉水中的CECs标准争论尤其激烈。

## Contaminants of emerging concern in urban wastemwater: classification, environmental sources and legislation

* 主要新兴污染物在水环境中的存在浓度范围在0.001-10μg/L，而PhACs环境检出浓度通常高于1μg/L.

* The limits for CECs in wastewater discharge are still not regulated.尚无针对新兴污染物的管理指标

* **The Global Water Research Coalition (GWRC)** developed an [International Priority List of PhACs relevant for the water cycle](), based on the compounds that present a potential risk in water supply. 国际药物活性物质优先污染物清单

* According to GWRC, 44 compounds are classified in three main groups: Class I(10), Class II(18) and Class III(16), based on the following criteria: human toxicity, ecotoxicity, degradabillity, resistance to treatment and occurance in the environment.根据人体毒性、生态毒性、可降解性、处理残留性和环境存在情况分类。

* The classification, source and legislation of relevant CECs occurring in secondary treated effulents, that were included in the present review paper, are presented in Table SI1. Based on tecommendations of the NEREUS COST Action, 25 CECs were selected according to criteria relevant for wastewater reuse such as (i) relevance to crop uptake, (ii) concern for human and environmental health, (iii) recalcitrance and (iv) frequency of detection. The criteria ate described in detail by [Krzeminski et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718330948), where the fate of CECs in biological treatment is reviewed.综述给了二级出水中相关CECS的分类、来源和法规。根据作物摄取、生态健康风险、残留性与检出频率选出25种CECs。

* 氧化与活性炭吸附应用前景广阔，WWTP升级时经济实用型强，目前被广泛应用，也被用于生产再生水。

* Among the membrane technologies the most commonly implemented ones at full scale are the so-called pressure driven processes, which englobe nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO). In addition to dissolved organics, total dissolved solids (TDS) and inorganic ions are removed, with a higher rejection percentage in the case of RO. NF and RO processes also physically remove many pathogenic microorganisms providing a disinfection barrier, making them especially attractive for water reclamation processes. 纳滤和反渗透作用是应用最广泛的两种压力驱动膜技术，除了可去除可溶性有机物、总可溶物和无机离子，尤其是RO，还能去除致病微生物载体。因此可用于再生水回用过程。

* Ozonation（氧化）

> 氧化机制，包括直接氧化和间接氧化：The application of ozone generally involves two reaction mechanisms, the direct reaction by ozone and the indirect reaction of OH radicals (HO) that are formed during ozone reactions. 

>> Ozone reacts selectively with compounds containing electron-rich moieties such as olefins, deprotonated amines or activated aromatics, exhibiting reaction rate constants kO3 over several orders of magnitude in the range of 1 to 107 M−1 s−1.臭氧选择性地与富电子基团，如烯烃、铵离子或活泼芳香烃，进而呈现反应速率常数量级在1-10^7/(M·S)。

>> The major source for HO generation is the effluent organic matter (EfOM). HO are generated from a side reaction of ozone with specific groups of EfOM such as phenols or amines.氢氧根离子由出水中有机物EfOM产生，是臭氧与某些组分EfOM如酚类或胺类反应的副产物。

>> Due to the high HO generation potential of EfOM, effluent ozonation can be considered an AOP. In contrast to ozone, HO are characterised by low selectivity and a fast reaction with a wide range of organic and inorganic compounds, which makes the indirect reaction mechanism beneficial to the abatement of CECs refractory to ozone. 氢氧根离子反应活性强，可与广泛有机、无机组分反应，间接氧化CECs，包括臭氧难氧化的顽固组分CECs。

>> CECs degradation during ozonation depends on the reaction rate constants of the respective CECs with ozone and HO and the oxidant exposure. CECs的氧化降解取决于各CEC的臭氧反应速率常数、氢氧根离子反应速率常数以及氧化暴露。

* EfOM contains numerous ozone reactive moieties, resulting in a considerable oxidant consumption.EfOM包含众多臭氧活性基团，造成大量氧化剂消耗。The wastewater matrix is dominant for ozone and HO consumption, rather than the presence of CECs.

* Usually, the so-called specific ozone dose (Dspec in g O3/g DOC) is applied, where ozone is dosed as a function of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content in the wastewater. 特定氧剂量，每克DOC消耗的O3(g).

* Nitrite (another decisive parameter) reacts fast with ozone in a molar ratio of 1:1, consuming 3.43 g O3 per g NO2-N. The fast reaction results in a competition with CECs abatement. Thus, in addition to the DOC-normalisation, a nitrite compensation needs to be considered when applying the specific ozone dose as principle for feed-forward process control.亚硝酸盐竞争耗氧，需考虑亚硝酸盐补偿。

* UV absorption at 254 nm (UV254) is a simple sum parameter that in contrast to DOC, significantly decreases during ozonation. The advantage of this feed-back process control concept is the automatic consideration of nitrite since the ozone consumed by nitrite is not available for CEC oxidation and does not result in a UV decrease.UV254反应CECs的变化而不反应亚硝酸盐的变化，因此自动考虑亚硝酸盐补偿。

* The formation of transformation products (deriving from CECs) and oxidation by-products (deriving from the wastewater matrix) is an important issue for ozonation since the applied doses do not result in mineralization. 由于投加的臭氧不能直接矿化，生成CECs转化生物和消毒副产物。Two important oxidation by-products that should be analysed according to the authors are bromate and NDMA.溴化产物和NDMA是两类重要的消毒副产物。NDMA can be formed during ozonation from precursors like hydrazines and sulfonamides (yield >50%) .NDMA通过前体物如联胺、磺胺类氧化生成。

* 水质安全生物评估 (the Ames test, the Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES), and the combined algae assay (performed with solid phase extracted (SPE) samples to be sensitive enough), as well as the Ceriodaphnia dubia reproduction assay and the fish embryo toxicity test with Danio rerio (performed with native wastewater effluent samples to include the effect of very polar compounds not well extracted by SPE).

* Activated carbon（AC，活性炭吸附）

> AC is generally known for its adsorption ability towards a broad spectrum of CECs, due to its high porosity, large surface area and high degree of surface interactions.活性炭吸附由于其多孔性、大比表面积和表面作用程度度，可吸附广谱CECs。According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the AC is classified according to the pore diameter: macroporous (≥50 nm), mesoporous (2–50 nm), secondary microporous (0.8–2 nm) and primary microporous (≤0.8 nm). 根据孔径分类Mesoporous AC was found to be the most suitable for CECs adsorption due to the reduced impact of organic matter competition on the surface sites.大孔活性炭可降低表面位点上有机物的竞争。

|*macroporous*| mesoporous| secondary microporous|primary microporous|
|-|-|-|-|
|≥50 nm|2–50 nm|0.8–2 nm|(≤0.8 nm)|

> 根据形状分类：粉末状活性炭PAC和颗粒状活性炭GAC。AC is commonly applied as a powdered slurry feed (i.e. powdered AC, PAC) into a contact reactor, or in a granular form (i.e. granular AC, GAC) in a packed bed filter.

* 吸附竞争The basic principle of the adsorption process is to transfer CECs from the liquid phase to the solid one. During the adsorption competition occurs: (1) direct in between of small organic molecules for the same activated surface sites, e.g. the high energy adsorption sites in the micropores of the AC and (2) pore blocking by the large organic molecules that hinder the entrance of CEC into the appropriate adsorption sites. The competitive adsorption depends on a variety of factors related to the adsorbent surface characteristics , such as: AC surface area, particle size, pore size distribution and surface chemistry (e.g., surface charge - acidity or basicity). Moreover, the efficacy of the adsorption process is affected by the nature of the adsorbed compounds (e.g. hydrophobicity, chemical structure, and charge). The specific physicochemical properties of the target pollutants in the water matrix determine its adsorption potential or the resistance against the adsorption competition on the AC. The pH and temperature of wastewater are external factors that affect the removal of CECs in wastewater effluents. 

* AC表面组成。The AC surface is predominantly hydrophobic but may also contain heteroatoms (oxygen, hydrogen, chlorine, nitrogen and sulfur), which determine the acid/base character of the surface and specific interactions with adsorbed compounds. 

* The adsorption of the EfOM, which is generally negatively charged in wastewater, alters the initial AC surface (neutral or positive charged) or increase (in case of initially negative surface sites) the total charge of the AC surface.EfOM通常是负电荷，可改变正电荷或中性AC表面，或增加负电荷总量。The physico-chemical characteristics of the CECs such as polarity, molecular weight and the presence of different functional groups and charges (and their interaction with the AC surface sites altered by EfOM) are crucial parameters that determine their removal.

* Membrane filtration processes（膜滤）
